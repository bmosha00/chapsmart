                <p>These Terms and Conditions govern your use of the service provided by Chapsmart Ltd (hereinafter “Chapsmart”), a company registered with the Business Registration and Licensing Agency (BRELA) in Tanzania.</p>

                <p>Chapsmart provides a payment disbursement service that enables users outside Tanzania to send payments to third parties in Tanzania, such as merchants, service providers, or individuals, using Bitcoin as the payment method for this service (hereinafter “The Services”). Chapsmart does not operate as a digital asset exchange, does not buy, sell, or trade digital assets, and does not facilitate the conversion of one type of digital asset to another (e.g., Bitcoin to TZS). Users pay Chapsmart in Bitcoin solely as compensation for the service of disbursing payments in Tanzanian Shillings (TZS) to designated recipients in Tanzania. Chapsmart does not purchase, sell, or take custody of users’ digital assets beyond receiving Bitcoin as payment for its services. The Services may be provided in cooperation with third-party providers (e.g., mobile money operators). Your use of the Services is hence additionally subject to the terms of our third-party provider(s), which you must accept before using the Services.</p>

                <p>This User Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Tanzania. While Chapsmart operates in compliance with Tanzanian law as a provider of payment disbursement services, users are solely responsible for ensuring their compliance with Tanzanian tax laws and any applicable laws in their jurisdiction, including those related to digital assets, when utilizing Chapsmart’s services.</p>

                <p>By registering to the Chapsmart platform and using The Services, you agree that you have read, understood, and accepted all the Terms and Conditions of Chapsmart Ltd and our third-party provider(s). At any time, Chapsmart Ltd has the right to modify these Terms and Conditions.</p>

                <h3>Access to the Site</h3>
                <p>We do not guarantee that your use of the Site will always be available or uninterrupted.

                <h3>Nature of Transactions and User Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Chapsmart’s service involves the receipt of Bitcoin from users outside Tanzania as payment for facilitating disbursements in TZS to third parties within Tanzania. This transaction is a purchase of Chapsmart’s payment disbursement service, not a sale of digital assets by the user to Chapsmart, nor a conversion of digital assets from one form to another. Chapsmart does not provide exchange services or act as a marketplace for digital assets. Users are solely responsible for determining and complying with any tax obligations that may arise from their use of Chapsmart’s services, including but not limited to Tanzania’s digital assets tax applicable to transactions involving the use of digital assets. Chapsmart does not collect, report, or remit taxes on behalf of users, and users are advised to consult a qualified tax advisor to understand their individual tax liabilities under Tanzanian law and the laws of their jurisdiction.</p>

                <h3>Liability</h3>
                <p>Users are responsible for their actions in connection with the use of the Site, Service, and their Accounts. Users are also responsible for protecting access information to the Site, including but not limited to private keys and passwords. The Company is not responsible for the outcome, whether positive or negative, of any action performed by any of its users within or related to the Site. The Company shall in no manner be liable for any transaction failure or loss caused due to any fault on the part of the User, including for the User providing any wrong information or detail. In the event the User deliberately provides false information and/or provides any misrepresentation and/or attempts to create false information and/or impersonate any other person and/or attempts to breach the Chapsmart Terms and Conditions, the User shall be liable to indemnify the Company, and the Company may take all necessary legal actions against the User, including any criminal action.</p>

                <p>The parties agree that in no event shall the Company or its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers be liable for lost profits or any special, incidental, or consequential damages arising out of or in connection with the use of our Site, Service, or these Terms and Conditions. In case the applicable laws do not permit the limitation or exclusion of damages as described above, our aggregate liability (including the liability of our affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, and suppliers) in respect of claims based on events arising out of or in connection with any single member’s use of the Site, whether in contract or tort or otherwise, shall in no circumstances exceed the amount of the transaction(s) that are the subject of the claim less any amount of commission that may be due and payable in respect of such transaction(s).</p>

                <p>We have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of services or goods that you may pay for through third parties (including other users of the Services) using our disbursement service.</p>

                <p>We shall not be liable or responsible for any risk associated with such third-party transactions, including any issue that may arise in respect of banking or mobile money transactions that you may undertake in pursuance thereof.</p>

                <p>Chapsmart is not liable for any taxes, penalties, or interest imposed by the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) or any other tax authority arising from your use of our services, including but not limited to the digital assets tax. As Chapsmart does not engage in the sale, exchange, or conversion of digital assets, we do not assume any responsibility for determining or ensuring your compliance with applicable tax laws. Any tax obligations related to paying Chapsmart in Bitcoin for our payment disbursement services rest solely with you, the user.</p>

Our decision in relation to such dispute shall be final and binding on you.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding anything contained herein, we reserve the right to decide if a dispute exists in relation to any transaction undertaken on the Site by you with a third party, and our decision in relation to the same shall be final and binding on you.</p>

                <h3>Copyrights and Other Intellectual Property Rights</h3>
                <p>Unless otherwise indicated by us, all copyright and other intellectual property rights in all content and other materials contained on our website or provided in connection with the Services, including, without limitation, the Chapsmart logo and all designs, text, graphics, pictures, information, data, software, sound files, other files, and the selection and arrangement thereof (collectively “Chapsmart Materials”) are the proprietary property of Chapsmart Ltd or our licensors or suppliers.</p>

                <h3>Amendment and Changes</h3>
                <p>We may revise these Terms and Conditions at any time by amending this page. Please check this page from time to time to take notice of any changes we made, as they are binding on you.</p>

                <p>We may, without prior notice, change the Services; add or remove functionalities or features; stop providing the Services or features of the Services to you or to Users generally; or create usage limits for the Services.</p>

                <h3>Taxes</h3>
                <p>It is your responsibility to determine, collect, report, and submit any taxes applicable to the payments you make to Chapsmart in Bitcoin for its payment disbursement services, including any obligations under Tanzania’s digital assets tax laws, which apply to the use of digital assets for services. Chapsmart does not sell digital assets, convert digital assets, or use your Bitcoin to purchase goods or services on your behalf; Chapsmart’s service is limited to disbursing TZS to third parties in Tanzania after receiving Bitcoin as payment. Accordingly, Chapsmart is not responsible for collecting, reporting, or remitting any taxes to the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) or any other tax authority on your behalf. You should consult a tax professional to understand how Tanzanian tax laws and the laws of your jurisdiction apply to your use of Chapsmart’s services.</p>

                <p>Chapsmart is registered with the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and complies with applicable tax obligations, including the 3% withholding tax on digital asset transactions as per the Finance Act 2024.</p>

                <h3>Fees</h3>
                <p>Users compensate Chapsmart for its payment disbursement services by sending Bitcoin via the Lightning Network. This Bitcoin payment represents a fee for Chapsmart’s service of disbursing TZS to third-party recipients in Tanzania on the user’s behalf. Chapsmart does not sell, exchange, or convert users’ Bitcoin into other digital assets or fiat currency for the user’s benefit; rather, Chapsmart receives Bitcoin as payment and independently handles the disbursement process in TZS. Chapsmart does not assume liability for any taxes, including Tanzania’s digital assets tax, that may apply to users’ transactions. Users are responsible for assessing and fulfilling their own tax obligations related to paying Chapsmart in Bitcoin and should seek professional tax advice as needed.</p>

                <p>Chapsmart charges the following fees for the Services we provide through the Platform:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fee Type:</strong> Virtual Asset Payment</li>
                    <li><strong>Amount:</strong> 0 TZS and 5% of the transaction value (calculated based on the TZS amount disbursed)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Risks</h3>
                <p>A considerable loss may be sustained/incurred while using Chapsmart Services due to the nature of digital assets. Therefore, it is advised that you carefully determine your financial circumstances and risk tolerance before engaging with our Services. Additionally, you should consider the following risks associated with Digital Assets:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Digital Assets are subject to evolving regulations:</strong> The regulatory environment surrounding Digital Assets is constantly changing and may differ depending on your location. Some jurisdictions may currently lack specific regulations, while others may impose restrictions on holding and transferring Digital Assets in the future. It is essential to stay informed about regulatory developments and, if necessary, seek appropriate legal counsel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of recognition as a medium of payment or commodity:</strong> Virtual currencies, including cryptocurrencies, may not be recognized or authorized as legal tender or an official medium of payment by central banks, monetary authorities, or governmental/regulatory bodies, including the Bank of Tanzania. They may also not be officially recognized as commodities for trade purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>High volatility and potential total loss:</strong> The value of Digital Assets can be highly volatile and may experience significant price fluctuations. As a result, there is a risk of financial loss due to market volatility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security and government crackdown risks:</strong> Since Digital Assets are held and transacted online, they are susceptible to security breaches and hacking attempts. Additionally, some governments may impose restrictions or crackdowns on the use of Digital Assets, potentially affecting their usability.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Please note that the above statement of risks associated with the use of Digital Assets is not exhaustive, and there may be additional risks not listed or foreseen by the Company. By creating a User Account, you acknowledge that you have carefully assessed your financial standing and risk tolerance, and you confirm that they are suitable for using Chapsmart Services. Furthermore, it is crucial to remain aware of the evolving regulatory landscape and potential risks associated with Digital Assets as the regulatory environment may change over time.</p>
